"""Minimal venue router: which venue executes what.

Two distinct moments, on purpose:

* **opening** — the venue is chosen from market and pair;
* **existing position** — the venue is *read* from the position, never chosen again.

The second rule is what prevents a position opened on one venue from being reduced
or closed on another. No hidden fallbacks: if no enabled venue can serve the
request the caller gets ``None`` and must skip with ``venue_unavailable``.
